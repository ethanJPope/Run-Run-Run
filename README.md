# Run Run Run
A fun and easy to play 2d platformer where your goal is to make it to the end. This game was fully made in Unity, my favorite way to make games. Most of the art was created by me. The parts not created by me were just assets I had bought in the past in huge bundel sales.

## My Proccess for creating this game:
1. Come up with an idea:
     - I bounced back and forth with chatgpt
     - Then used the jumpscare part to guid the idea
     - Then I came up with the idea of a 2d platformer and when you get jumpscared in the air you will loose all of your upward momenum causing you to fall (sorry if this happend to anyone)
2. Start prototyping:
    - I starting making a test scene to test all of the parts to see if my idea could work
    - Then I added a way to collect pumkins as a way to add to the theming
3. Art
    - I started with the player. This player wasn't too bad to come up with designs/animations, but the onw hickup was the jump because the animation was looping
    - Next was the tileset. I ended up with a simple ground sprite, a bellow-ground, and a platform sprite(fence sprite)
    - Lastly I drew the jumpscare image
4. Powerups
    - At this point it was Wednesday, with not a lot of ideas.
    - Then I desided the best way to approch this was powerups
    - This is because it fits perfectly with my time. For example if I have extra time I just keep making more powerups.
    - In the end I ended up with just 2 powerups, a double jump and a horizontal dash
    - With these new powerups there needs to be a way to earn them, in my case, a shop.
    - With this shop complexities that I had never delt with, like having an overlay infront of the game scene and pausing time
5. The challenge for the player
    - I desided the best way to challenge player is the use of time
    - So I implemented a time mechanic so that the player can see both their current time and their best time.
       * I wish I could implement a worldwide leaderboard, but time did not allow for it.
6. Home Screen
     - The last thing I added was a home screen
     - On this screen was the controls
     - And a play button
